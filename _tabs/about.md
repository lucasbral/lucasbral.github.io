Welcome to my blog, where I share knowledge and topics I'm currently studying or have experience in. Here, you will find posts about my areas of interest, including data analysis, data science, systems engineering, equipment protection, and much more!

## About Me

I'm Lucas Sobral, a data analyst at a major telecommunications company in Brazil. My work involves detailed analysis of TV products, comparing indicators like NPS, and technical performance analysis. I have experience in handling large volumes of data, developing complex ETLs, web scraping, as well as conducting experimental studies focused on protection systems.

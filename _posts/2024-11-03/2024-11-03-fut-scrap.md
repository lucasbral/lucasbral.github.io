## Motivation

The motivation for this tutorial comes from a close friend of mine, who is a data scientist and asked for my help with one of his personal projects. His goal is to build a predictive model to estimate the minute of play when the first yellow card will be issued in soccer matches. For this, the chosen football statistics platform is [Opta Player Stats](https://optaplayerstats.statsperform.com), and the selected league is the Brazilian Série A.


## Studying the Website and Defining Variables


On the website, there is a specific link that lists all matches of the year for a given football championship. In the case of the link [Opta Player Stats](https://optaplayerstats.statsperform.com/en_GB/soccer/brasileir%C3%A3o-s%C3%A9rie-a-2023/czjx4rda7swlzql5d1cq90r8/opta-player-stats) - Brasileirão Série A 2023, it provides all the matches of the 2023 Brazilian Championship. Each game has its own specific link that displays detailed information for each individual match, and this will be the first piece of information we need to collect.


![desktop View](assets/img/2024-11-03/1.png)
_View of the site_

Using the Firefox browser and pressing the F12 key to access the HTML file of the page, you can view all the information. In the path shown in the image below, we find the class that defines all the matches.

![desktop View](assets/img/2024-11-03/2.png)
_Classes on the website that refer to matches_

> Note that the classes starting with `Opta-fixture Opta-Match` are responsible for providing information for each game in the championship.
{: .prompt-tip }

With this information, we can start writing our code to extract these data.

## Extracting Matchs Links

The code below reads the HTML from the link containing the championship matches and uses BeautifulSoup to filter the Opta-fixture Opta-Match class, returning only the href parameter of each one.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

# URL of the championship
url = "https://optaplayerstats.statsperform.com/pt_BR/soccer/brasileir%C3%A3o-s%C3%A9rie-a-2023/czjx4rda7swlzql5d1cq90r8/opta-player-stats"

# Set up Selenium with headless Firefox
option = Options()
option.headless = True
driver = webdriver.Firefox(options=option)
# Load the page
driver.get(url)
time.sleep(10)
html = driver.page_source
# Parse the HTML with BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
# Find the table with the class 'Opta-Crested'
table = soup.find('table', class_='Opta-Crested')
# Close the driver
driver.quit()
# Extract the href attributes of the links
part = [link['href'] for link in table.find_all('a', class_='Opta-MatchLink Opta-Ext')]
print("Total Matches:", len(part))
```
## Match Data

Now that we have the links for each match, it's necessary to extract the data from each match that is relevant for this study. The variables we will use are essentially those shown in the figure below.

![desktop View](assets/img/2024-11-03/3.png)
_Match info_

On the game timeline, there are symbols indicating yellow cards, goals, and own goals. When you hover the mouse over these symbols, the player responsible for the event and the minute it occurred in the game are displayed.
                                                                                                                                                      
## Extracting Match Data

Now that we have the information to be extracted from the site, we can develop the code needed to accomplish this task.

### Extracting Teams Infos

In this section, we will extract the data for the home team, away team, and the goals for each side. In the image below, you can see that the entire HTML block containing this information is within a `<table>` with the class `Opta-MatchHeader Opta-MatchHeader-Crested`.

![desktop View](assets/img/2024-11-03/4.png)
_Html that show teams infos_

We can then use BeautifulSoup to extract the information contained within these specific classes.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

# URL of the championship
url = "https://optaplayerstats.statsperform.com/pt_BR/soccer/brasileir%C3%A3o-s%C3%A9rie-a-2023/czjx4rda7swlzql5d1cq90r8/match/view/dykfkagvqqndkwt56ph8meqz8/match-summary"

# Set up Selenium with headless Firefox
option = Options()
option.headless = True
driver = webdriver.Firefox(options=option)
# Load the page
driver.get(url)
time.sleep(10)
html = driver.page_source
# Parse the HTML with BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
# Find the table with the class 'Opta-Crested'
table = soup.find('table', class_='Opta-Crested')
# Close the driver
driver.quit()

home_teams = soup.find_all('td', class_=lambda x: x and x.startswith('Opta-Team Opta-Home Opta-Team-Left Opta-TeamName'))
away_teams = soup.find_all('td', class_=lambda x: x and x.startswith('Opta-Team Opta-Away Opta-Team-Right Opta-TeamName'))

home_team_names = [team.text.strip() for team in home_teams]
away_team_names = [team.text.strip() for team in away_teams]

match_widget_container = soup.find('div', class_='match-widget-container')
home_scores = match_widget_container.find_all('td', class_=lambda x: x and x.startswith('Opta-Score Opta-Home Opta-Team'))
away_scores = match_widget_container.find_all('td', class_=lambda x: x and x.startswith('Opta-Score Opta-Away Opta-Team'))

# Extraia os placares dos times
home_team_score = [score.find('span', class_='Opta-Team-Score').text.strip() for score in home_scores]
away_team_score = [score.find('span', class_='Opta-Team-Score').text.strip() for score in away_scores]

print(home_team_names)
print(away_team_names)
print(home_team_score)
print(away_team_score)
```

With this, our code is now able to retrieve the team information and the game score.

### Extracting Matchs Infos

Now we need to develop the part of the code that will retrieve information about the match stadium, attendance, and the referee who officiated the game.

![desktop View](assets/img/2024-11-03/5.png)
_Html that show match data_

> Note that the class responsible for providing this information is `Opta-Matchdata`. Therefore, we use BeautifulSoup to extract it.
{: .prompt-tip }

```python
#keep the same libraries and driver configuration from the previous code.

match_data = soup.find_all('div', class_='Opta-Matchdata')
match_data_text = [data.text.strip() for data in match_data]

est = public = ref = "No data"

if match_data:
    for data in match_data:
        dls = data.find_all('dl')
        for dl in dls:
            dt = dl.find('dt').text.strip()
            dd = dl.find('dd').text.strip()
            if dt == 'Est':
                est = dd
            elif dt == 'P':
                public = dd
            else:
                ref = dd

print(est)
print(public)
print(ref)
```
> This part of the code was configured in my native language, Brazilian Portuguese. For other languages, simply change the text that appears before each information topic. For example, "Est" becomes "Venue" in English, and so on.
{: .prompt-danger }

### Extracting Cards Infos

To extract information about cards during the game, we will use the data contained in the match timeline. The HTML divides the timeline into two parts: one for the home team, defined as `Opta-Events Opta-Home`, and another for the away team, as `Opta-Events Opta-Away`.

Knowing this, we will extract these two pieces of information separately.

Another important detail is that each event occurring within the timeline has a specific numbering, which starts with `opta-MatchEvent Opta...`, as shown in the figure below.

Additionally, the site defines three types of cards: yellow, red, and second yellow.

This classification is determined by the type of icon displayed in the timeline. There are three types of classes for these icons:
- `Opta-Icon Opta-IconYellow` for yellow cards
- `Opta-Icon Opta-IconRed` for red cards
- `Opta-Icon Opta-IconDouble` for second yellow cards

![desktop View](assets/img/2024-11-03/6.png)
_Html that show timeline data_

With this information, we can develop the code below:


```python
#keep the same libraries and driver configuration from the previous code.

home_events_list = soup.find_all('ul', class_='Opta-Events Opta-Home')
events_home = []
for home_events in home_events_list:
    events_home.extend(home_events.find_all('li', class_=lambda x: x and x.startswith('Opta-MatchEvent Opta-Event-Type')))

yellow_cards_home = []
red_cards_home = []
sec_card_home = []

for event in events_home:
    minute = event.find('span', class_='Opta-Event-Min').text.strip().replace('\u200e', '').replace('\u200f', '')
    if event.find('p', class_='Opta-Icon Opta-IconYellow'):
        player_img = event.find('img')
        if player_img and 'alt' in player_img.attrs:
            player = player_img['alt'].strip()
        else:
            player = "undefined"
        yellow_cards_home.append({'player': player, 'minute': minute})
    elif event.find('p', class_='Opta-Icon Opta-IconRed'):
        player_img = event.find('img')
        if player_img and 'alt' in player_img.attrs:
            player = player_img['alt'].strip()
        else:
            player = "undefined"
        red_cards_home.append({'player': player, 'minute': minute})
    elif event.find('p', class_='Opta-Icon Opta-IconDouble'):
        player_img = event.find('img')
        if player_img and 'alt' in player_img.attrs:
            player = player_img['alt'].strip()
        else:
            player = "undefined"
        sec_card_home.append({'player': player, 'minute': minute})


away_events_list = soup.find_all('ul', class_='Opta-Events Opta-Away')
#events AWAY
events_away = []
for away_events in away_events_list:
    events_away.extend(away_events.find_all('li', class_=lambda x: x and x.startswith('Opta-MatchEvent Opta-Event-Type')))

yellow_cards_away = []
red_cards_away = []
sec_card_away = []

for event in events_away:
    minute = event.find('span', class_='Opta-Event-Min').text.strip().replace('\u200e', '').replace('\u200f', '')
    if event.find('p', class_='Opta-Icon Opta-IconYellow'):
        player_img = event.find('img')
        if player_img and 'alt' in player_img.attrs:
            player = player_img['alt'].strip()
        else:
            player = "undefined"
        yellow_cards_away.append({'player': player, 'minute': minute})
    elif event.find('p', class_='Opta-Icon Opta-IconRed'):
        player_img = event.find('img')
        if player_img and 'alt' in player_img.attrs:
            player = player_img['alt'].strip()
        else:
            player = "undefined"
        red_cards_away.append({'player': player, 'minute': minute})
    elif event.find('p', class_='Opta-Icon Opta-IconDouble'):
        player_img = event.find('img')
        if player_img and 'alt' in player_img.attrs:
            player = player_img['alt'].strip()
        else:
            player = "undefined"
        sec_card_away.append({'player': player, 'minute': minute})
```
With this code, we then create six variables that store a JSON array with information about the players who received the card and the specific minute, as shown in the table below:

| var                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **yellow_cards_home** | A JSON array containing information about yellow cards received by players of the home team. Each object in the array includes: <br> - **player**: The name of the player who received the yellow card. <br> - **minute**: The minute when the yellow card was given.                      |
| **red_cards_home**    | A JSON array containing information about red cards received by players of the home team. Each object in the array includes: <br> - **player**: The name of the player who received the red card. <br> - **minute**: The minute when the red card was given.                               |
| **yellow_cards_away** | A JSON array containing information about yellow cards received by players of the away team. Each object in the array includes: <br> - **player**: The name of the player who received the yellow card. <br> - **minute**: The minute when the yellow card was given.                      |
| **red_cards_away**    | A JSON array containing information about red cards received by players of the away team. Each object in the array includes: <br> - **player**: The name of the player who received the red card. <br> - **minute**: The minute when the red card was given.                               |
| **sec_card_home**     | A JSON array containing information about second yellow cards received by players of the home team. Each object in the array includes: <br> - **player**: The name of the player who received the second yellow card. <br> - **minute**: The minute when the second yellow card was given. |
| **sec_card_away**     | A JSON array containing information about second yellow cards received by players of the away team. Each object in the array includes: <br> - **player**: The name of the player who received the second yellow card. <br> - **minute**: The minute when the second yellow card was given. |



### Extracting Goals Infos

The process for extracting goal information is quite similar to that of cards. The difference is that we will use the following classes:
- `Opta-Icon Opta-IconGoal` for a normal goal
- `Opta-Icon Opta-IconOwn` for an own goal
- `Opta-Icon Opta-IconPenGoal` for a penalty goal

The code then looks like this:

```python
#keep the same libraries and driver configuration from the previous code.

home_events_list = soup.find_all('ul', class_='Opta-Events Opta-Home')
events_home = []
for home_events in home_events_list:
    events_home.extend(home_events.find_all('li', class_=lambda x: x and x.startswith('Opta-MatchEvent Opta-Event-Type')))

gols_home = []

for event in events_home:
    minute = event.find('span', class_='Opta-Event-Min').text.strip().replace('\u200e', '').replace('\u200f', '')
    if event.find('p', class_='Opta-Icon Opta-IconGoal'):
        player_img = event.find('img')
        if player_img and 'alt' in player_img.attrs:
            player = player_img['alt'].strip()
        else:
            player = "undefined"
        gols_home.append({'player': player, 'minute': minute, 'cont': 0, 'penal': 0})
    elif event.find('p', class_='Opta-Icon Opta-IconOwn'):
        player_img = event.find('img')
        if player_img and 'alt' in player_img.attrs:
            player = player_img['alt'].strip()
        else:
            player = "undefined"
        gols_home.append({'player': player, 'minute': minute, 'cont': 1, 'penal': 0})
    elif event.find('p', class_='Opta-Icon Opta-IconPenGoal'):
        player_img = event.find('img')
        if player_img and 'alt' in player_img.attrs:
            player = player_img['alt'].strip()
        else:
            player = "undefined"
        gols_home.append({'player': player, 'minute': minute, 'cont': 0, 'penal': 1})


away_events_list = soup.find_all('ul', class_='Opta-Events Opta-Away')
#events AWAY
events_away = []
for away_events in away_events_list:
    events_away.extend(away_events.find_all('li', class_=lambda x: x and x.startswith('Opta-MatchEvent Opta-Event-Type')))

gols_away = []

for event in events_away:
    minute = event.find('span', class_='Opta-Event-Min').text.strip().replace('\u200e', '').replace('\u200f', '')
    if event.find('p', class_='Opta-Icon Opta-IconGoal'):
        player_img = event.find('img')
        if player_img and 'alt' in player_img.attrs:
            player = player_img['alt'].strip()
        else:
            player = "undefined"
        gols_away.append({'player': player, 'minute': minute, 'cont': 0, 'penal': 0})
    elif event.find('p', class_='Opta-Icon Opta-IconOwn'):
        player_img = event.find('img')
        if player_img and 'alt' in player_img.attrs:
            player = player_img['alt'].strip()
        else:
            player = "undefined"
        gols_away.append({'player': player, 'minute': minute, 'cont': 1, 'penal': 0})
    elif event.find('p', class_='Opta-Icon Opta-IconPenGoal'):
        player_img = event.find('img')
        if player_img and 'alt' in player_img.attrs:
            player = player_img['alt'].strip()
        else:
            player = "undefined"
        gols_away.append({'player': player, 'minute': minute, 'cont': 0, 'penal': 1})
```
With this code, we then create two variables that store the goals of the home team and the away team in the format below:

| var           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **gols_home** | A JSON array containing information about goals scored by players of the home team. Each object in the array includes: <br> - **player**: The name of the player who scored the goal. <br> - **minute**: The minute when the goal was scored. <br> - **cont**: Indicates if the goal was an own goal (1 for own goal, 0 otherwise). <br> - **penal**: Indicates if the goal was a penalty (1 for penalty, 0 otherwise). |
| **gols_away** | A JSON array containing information about goals scored by players of the away team. Each object in the array includes: <br> - **player**: The name of the player who scored the goal. <br> - **minute**: The minute when the goal was scored. <br> - **cont**: Indicates if the goal was an own goal (1 for own goal, 0 otherwise). <br> - **penal**: Indicates if the goal was a penalty (1 for penalty, 0 otherwise). |

## Conclusions

With the information provided here, it is possible to build a program that extracts football match information from any championship available at optaplayerstats.statsperform.com. The link to this complete project is on [GitHub](https://github.com/lucasbral/fut_scrap/tree/main).

By using this program, it was possible to create a dataset with the data from all matches of the Brasileirão from 2020 to 2023, which can be found at this link on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucasbral/brasileirao-cartoes-20-23/).
